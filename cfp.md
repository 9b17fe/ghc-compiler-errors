Abstract Title: Seriously, the Haskell Type Checker is Your
Friend: a Pragmatic Approach to Working with GHC Errors

Abstract Topic: Concepts, Cautionary Tales
Submission Type: Educational Session (50m)

Abstract Summary: When youâ€™re just getting started with Haskell, you might write code that you would expect to work, but GHC complains. We are going to cover common GHC type errors through code examples and work through how to solve them step by step. Code snippets will be shown in the slides, but there will also be some live coding to show which compiler errors we get in GHCi. Code examples will show errors and iterate through examples of common beginner mistakes. The presentation will show how beginner errors can compound and lead them astray and how to properly interpret GHC errors to avoid this.

Content Relevancy: Haskell beginners and intermediates (but not neophytes) attending this talk will be able to identify and fix GHC compiler errors more quickly after this talk by seeing common errors worked through and explained in terms attendees learning Haskell can understand.
