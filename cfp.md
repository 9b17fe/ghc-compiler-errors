Abstract Title: Seriously, the Haskell Type Checker is Your
Friend: a Pragmatic Approach to Working with GHC Errors

Abstract Topic: Concepts, Cautionary Tales
Submission Type: Educational Session (50m)

Abstract Summary: When youâ€™re just getting started with 
Haskell, you might write code that you would expect to 
work, but GHC complains. There are lots of difficult errors that you
encounter when you first get started with Haskell. The error
messages can seem cryptic. It's easier to identify 
and solve these errors later on if you have someone explain 
to you what the error message means at least once. 
I know that I have personally been led astray on what I should 
be doing in order to fix an error and make my code do what I want.
I will cover GHC type errors by showing code examples 
and work through, step by step, how to fix these errors. 
I will have code snippets in the slides to highlight problems. 
Additionally, I will do some live coding to show which compiler errors
we get in GHCi. Code examples will show errors and iterate
through examples of common beginner mistakes. 
The presentation will show how beginner errors can compound 
and lead them to misinterpret the problem. 
I will address how to properly identify GHC errors to avoid this.

My personal motivation for this talk to create more resources
for beginners. I think that Haskell is powerful because of the the way
you can concisely express complex code expressions.
Once you get past the learning curve Haskell can be a very 
productive and enjoyable language to use. However, I don't think
most people that try Haskell ever get to this point currently.
I don't think that I'm even at this point yet!
I believe there is a cultural problem (as viewed by beginners) 
within the language that focuses on these cooler topics 
that already productive Haskell users enjoy while there's a lack of
community/resources to support people trying to learn (kudos to the people that do).
It's pretty frustrating to learn Haskell and I think the community gets
a bad reputation for that. I would like to make the barrier to 
entry less by creating content that excites, sympathisizes with, 
and helps someone that is just getting started.

Content Relevancy: Haskell beginners and intermediates 
(but not neophytes) attending this talk will be able to 
identify and fix GHC compiler errors more quickly after this
talk by seeing common errors worked through and explained
in terms attendees learning Haskell can understand.
