Abstract Title: A Pragmatic Guide to GHC Errors
Abstract Topic: Concepts, Cautionary Tales
Submission Type: Educational Session (50m)

Abstract Summary: When you’re just getting started with Haskell, you might write code that you would expect to work, but GHC complains

<!-- and maybe it suggests a language extension. But what do those extensions really do? Using code examples, we are going to walk through what these language extensions mean, when you will need to use them, and when turning on language extensions would end up causing more problems than they would solve. We’ll dig into the history of Haskell including why particular extensions are on by default in GHCi and the implementation choices chosen in some typeclasses. -->

Code examples will show errors and iterate through examples of common beginner mistakes. The presentation will show how beginner errors can compound and lead them astray and how to properly interpret GHC errors to avoid this.

Content Relevancy: Haskell beginners attending this talk will be able to identify and fix GHC compiler errors more quickly after this talk by seeing common errors worked through and explained in terms beginners and intermediates (but not neophytes) learning Haskell can understand.

<!-- solved by language extensions. They’ll also get to learn the history and intention behind certain language choices which will lead to writing more thoughtful and error free code in the future. -->
